the index button list on the left side of the screen can be scrolled by dragging it up and down.

## Books ##

if you now press on a collection, you will be shows the list of books that are in that collection.

The list will be updated and the 'Sorted by Title' text will change to 'Sorted by Author'. if you press the sort button again, the sort order will change to 'filename' and the text will change to "Sorted by filename'.

if you select a letter from the left hand side of the book list you will see all of the books whose title begins with that letter.

and again you can then sort that selection of books by using the sort button.
